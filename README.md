# DOM Single Page Application

## Introduction

The goal is to create an website with only 1 HTML but that looks like multiple pages. Everytime the user will click on a page, the DOM is going to be changed to only render the part that is interesting. 


## Init

Fork the project and clone it!


## CSS

First, edit `style.css` to create a website that looks similar to this:

At this stage, don't worry if you see all the pages (home, about, rules and high scores), we will change this in the next part!

## JavaScript

Edit the file `js/navigation.js` and write the 2 pre-made functions.
